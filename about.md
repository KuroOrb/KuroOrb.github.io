## Work Hard to be Lazy

_My motto to live by._
{:.lead}

> “Working hard to be lazy basically means investing the extra effort (working hard) at first so that it will pay off in the long run (be lazy).”

## Re-evaluate your work processes

The lazy man will try to accomplish 2 hours worth of work in 1 hour’s time but sometimes at the expense of the work’s quality.<br>
Think of it as **efficiency = quality/time** taken (referencing speed = distance/over).<br>
If the time taken is reduced, either the job’s quality has to be lowered or the efficiency must be increased. Efficiency really relates to the work process.<br>
So in order to keep the quality the same and reduce the time taken, the work process must be changed.

## Don’t repeat yourself

After evaluating what you do, you may have some ideas of what you want to improve or modify.<br>
Break it down to its core.

## Try a new process

Be open to completely changing the way you work.<br>
You can’t expect to become more productive unless you pay a price at first.

## Refine yourself

By refining yourself I mean going through this work hard to be lazy process in iterations.<br>
Try a new process, if that doesn’t help as much as you hoped, try another process.<br>
The worst thing that could happen is that you don’t find any improvement in your work process and go back to your original process and just work hard.<br>
Did you lose anything?
